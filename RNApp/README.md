## Best practices

When creating a directory it should have an index.js file (that is called when you reference the folder in other files) that exports the (directory's name).js. The (directory's name).js imports styles.js in the same folder and uses that istead of keeping them in the same folder. The best way to learn all of this stuff is just to dig around in the already written code and copy the style.
