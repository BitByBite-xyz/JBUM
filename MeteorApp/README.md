# MeteorApp

This is the backend for the RNApp as well as the admin panel. For the admin panel front end we are using angular js framework.

## What to look through 

- READ THE BOOK IN THE BACKEND CHANNEL ON SLACK (ESPECIALLY COLLECTIONS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS)

- [This](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/angular/creating-an-app) is the tutorial for working with meteor+angular and is what I am basing this project on.

- [A JavaScript Primer For Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/blog/javascript-for-meteor/)
